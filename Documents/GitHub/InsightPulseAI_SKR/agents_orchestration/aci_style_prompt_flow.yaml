  ACI.dev-style multi-API agent orchestration for Pulser. Allows Claude to interpret
  natural language prompts and execute chained actions using integrated APIs (e.g. Tavily, Gmail, Hacker News).

trigger_agent: claudepulser
entrypoint: process_user_prompt

agents:
  claudepulser:
    type: orchestrator
    tools:
      - kalaw.semantic_indexer
      - echo.signal_extractor
      - task_router.mcp_chain
    behavior: >
      Parse high-level task intent, extract sub-actions (search, fetch, email, summarize),
      delegate to appropriate agents, confirm execution path with Claudia, and route logs to SKR.

  kalaw:
    type: knowledge_indexer
    tools:
      - tavily.query
    capabilities:
      - context_enrichment
      - source_discovery
    notes: >
      Use Tavily to retrieve and rank relevant links. Return 3â€“5 summaries.

  echo:
    type: signal_parser
    tools:
      - hackernews.fetch_top
    capabilities:
      - live_feed_parsing
      - post-ranking

      - validator.email_format
      - checker.intent_safety
    notes: >
      Acts as safety check before emails are sent or API write actions are executed.

  - step: parse
    agent: claudepulser
    action: decompose user request into sub-tasks
  - step: source
    agent: kalaw
    action: retrieve supporting information (Tavily)
  - step: extract
    agent: echo
    action: fetch top content (e.g. Hacker News API)
  - step: validate
    agent: caca
    action: audit outbound email for structure + safety
  - step: dispatch
    agent: tala
    action: send email to external user via Gmail API
